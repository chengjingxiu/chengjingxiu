                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>CuriousCore is an <strong>education startup</strong> that helps mid-career professionals break into the User Experience (UX) Design industry, and supports business leaders in learning about the fundamentals of Human-Centered Design (HCD).</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>CuriousCore offers a <strong>variety of UX programs</strong>, including introductory and intensive courses that can be taken full-time or part-time.</p>
                <p>In order to improve their courses, marketing and sales, CuriousCore wants to <strong>better understand their potential and current customers</strong> and improve the way <strong>information is displayed on their website.</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>The Goal</h3>
                <p><strong>Understand the needs</strong> of CuriousCore customers and <strong>improve the user experience</strong> of the CuriousCore website.</p>                
                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>As the <strong>Product Researcher</strong>, I worked independently to conduct user research and define usability problems, and collaborated with the founder to edit the content and design of the website.</p>

            <h2>1. Empathise</h2>
            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>Firstly, I conducted a <strong>competitor analysis</strong> of education companies - both in Singapore and around the world - that offer UX bootcamps and UX courses.</p>
                <p>This competitor research provided us with a better understanding of the <strong>advantages and disadvantages</strong> of different UX programs and the <strong>strategies used to market these programmes</strong>, which helped to guide CuriousCore's marketing and content strategy.</p>
                <p class="notes">Unfortunately, I cannot show the the competitive analysis results because it contains sensitive information.</p></p>
            <h3>Surveys</h3>
                <p>To learn about the problems that visitors are facing on the CuriousCore website, I added a <strong>pop-up questionnaire</strong> on the CuriousCore website (using Hotjar) and sent out a <strong>survey</strong> to CuriousCore's mailing list.</p> 
                <p>The survey (created using Google Forms) was also used as a <strong>screener</strong> to recruit particiapnts for user interviews.</p>
            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
                <p>To gain a deeper understanding of the issues encountered by visitors on the website, I conducted remote user interviews (using Zoom) with <strong>6 prospective customers</strong> and <strong>3 current customers</strong>.</p>
                <p>During the interviews, participants provided information about their <strong>attributes</strong>, <strong>goals</strong>, and the <strong>challenges</strong> they faced when transitioning into the UX industry.</p>
                <p>They were then asked to <strong>interact with the CuriousCore website</strong> while thinking aloud.</p>

            <h3>Personas</h3>
                <p>I created <strong>three personas</strong> to capture the various profiles of potential CuriousCore customers.</p>
                <p class="notes">Unfortunately, I cannot show the the personas because they contain sensitive information.</p>
            <h3>Affinity Mapping</h3>
                <p>I conducted <strong>affinity mapping</strong> (using Miro) to identify the main usability issues on each page of the website, including the <strong>"Home"</strong> page, the <strong>"About"</strong> page, a <strong>"Webinar"</strong> page (where CuriousCore advertises their weekly webinars) and a <strong>"Course"</strong> page (where CuriousCore advertises one of their UX courses).</p>

                    <li><b>Home Page:</b> 
                        <ol>
                            <li>The company description was confusing - website visitors did not know that CuriousCore taught courses in User Experience (UX).</li>
                            <li>There was information targeted at enterprises which was irrelevant and confusing to some visitors</li>
                            <li>Website visitors could not find the links to CuriousCore's social media pages.</li>
                        </ol>

                            <li>Users were not able to understand what the company does from the About page.</li>
                            <li>There was also a lack of information to establish the reliability of the organisation.</li>
                            <li>The hero image was an irrelevant image of ocean waves.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <li><b>Webinar Page:</b>

                            <li>Important information such as the date and time of upcoming webinars couldn't be found easily.</li>
                            <li>Website visitors also did not know where or how to access the webinars.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <li><b>Course Page:</b> 
                        <ol>
                            <li>There was a confusing structure with too much information competing for attention.</li>
                            <li>There was too much text - many website visitors commented that they were "too lazy to read everything".</li>
                            <li>The testimonials from previous students were placed in many different places and lacked credibility.</li>

            <h3>About Page</h3>

                    <li>I added a specific description of what CuriousCore does as a company ("we specialise in helping mid-career professionals break into the UX Design industry".)</li>
                    <li>To establish credibility, I added information about CuriousCore's founder, the CuriousCore team and their educators.</li>

                    <li>An "overview" webinars page was created which shows the important information upfront. Visitors can navigate to a separate page to learn more.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>I changed the structure a linear flow, rather than two columns of information competing for attention at once. The structure followed the order of what participants felt were the most important pieces of information.</li>
                    <li>The amount of text was reduced, and more images and whitespace was added.</li>
                    <li>Student testimonials were grouped together into a single section and the specific dates of when they took the course were added to increase their credibility.</li>

            <h3>Reflections</h3>
            <p><b>What went well üòÑ:</b> In this project, I <strong>used research insights to drive design solutions</strong>. By basing my recommendations on evidence from the user research, I was able to come up with ideas that were effective at addressing real problems. In addition, by presenting the user research data to the stakeholder, I was able to justify the effectiveness of my design ideas and convince the stakeholder to implement my proposed solutions.</p>
            <p><b>What could be improved ü§î:</b> At early stages of the project, I proposed some ideas that were <strong>not feasible due to real-world constraints.</strong> For example, I initially proposed some design recommendations that were not implementable due to the constraints of the hosting platform (SquareSpace). Later in the project, rather than obsessing over pixel-perfect designs, I learnt to focus on more practical solutions such as changes to page structure and content.</p>
