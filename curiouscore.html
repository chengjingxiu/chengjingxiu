            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>CuriousCore is an education startup that specialises in helping mid-career professionals break into the User Experience (UX) Design industry, and helping business leaders to learn the fundamentals of Human-Centered Design (HCD). They offer a variety of UX programs, ranging from short, intensive courses to longer, part-time courses.</p>
            <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>In order to improve their courses, marketing and sales, CuriousCore wants to learn more about their prospective and current customers and improve the way information is displayed on their website.</p>
            <h3>Our Goal</h3>
                <p>The aim of this project was to <strong>understand the needs</strong> of CuriousCore customers, and to <strong>improve the user experience</strong> of the CuriousCore website.</p>

        <div class="case-study-page">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>Firstly, I conducted a competitor analysis of education companies - both in Singapore and around the world - that offer UX bootcamps and UX courses.</p>
                <p>This competitor research provided us with a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of different UX programs and how they are marketed, which helped to guide CuriousCore's marketing and content strategy.</p>
                <p class="notes">The Competitive Analysis is restricted to certain viewers because it contains sensitive information. Please drop me an email <a href="mailto:cjingxiu@gmail.com">(cjingxiu@gmail.com)</a> to request access.</p>
            <h3>Surveys</h3>
                <p>To learn about the problems that visitors are facing on the CuriousCore website, I added a pop-up questionnaire on the CuriousCore website and sent out a Google Form to CuriousCore's mailing list.</p>
                <p>The surveys showed that many of the website visitors were not able to obtain the information they needed. Some visitors also commented that the content was unclear and poorly organised.</p>

            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
                <p>To gain a deeper understanding of the issues encountered by visitors on the website, I conducted 9 remote user interviews (using Zoom) with 6 prospective customers and 3 current customers.</p>
                <p>These interviews provided us with valuable insights into the attributes, challenges and goals of potential customers. Using these findings, I created three personas to capture the various profiles of potential customers.</p>
                <p class="notes">The Personas are restricted to certain viewers because it contains sensitive information. Please drop me an email <a href="mailto:cjingxiu@gmail.com">(cjingxiu@gmail.com)</a> to request access.</p>
                <p>I also conducted Affinity Mapping on the interview responses. After identifying the main themes underlying the usability issues, I worked together with the founder of CuriousCore to address these problems by editing the content and design of the website.</p>

            <h3>Reflections</h3>
                <p>From this project, I learnt the value of using <strong>research to inform design</strong>. When I used evidence from user research to inform my design solutions, I was able to address the real problems faced by actual visitors of the website. Additionally, the stakeholder was more receptive to my design solutions when they were driven by data.</p>
                <p>This project also taught me the importance of <strong>adapting to limitations</strong> in the real world. In particular, the design changes that could be made to the website were constrained by the hosting platform (SquareSpace). Hence, rather than obsessing over pixel-perfect designs, I focused more on feasible solutions - such as changes to page structure and content.</p>
