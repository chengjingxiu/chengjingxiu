                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Everyday Vegan Grocer is <strong>Singapore's first vegan grocery!</strong></p>
                <p>They sell a variety of <strong>animal-friendly</strong> and <strong>planet-conscious</strong> products, including fresh fruits and vegetables, meat alternatives, convenience foods and drinks.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>Everyday Vegan Grocer operated primarily through their <strong>online store</strong>, which is created using Shopify's e-commerce platform.</p>
                <p>However, they have received some complaints about the <strong>usability of the website</strong> and the <strong>categorisation of their products</strong>.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>The Goal</h3>
                <p>Improve the <strong>usability</strong> and <strong>information architecture</strong> of the Everyday Vegan Grocer website.</p>
                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>As the <strong>UX Researcher</strong>, I was in charge of conducting the user research and user evaluation. I was also actively involved in ideation, especially in coming up with the new and improved information architecture.</p>

            <h2>1. Empathise</h2>
            <h3>Participants</h3>
                <p>We conducted our first round of research with <strong>8 participants</strong>. 6 participants were prospective customers who were <strong>vegan-curious</strong> and passionate about sustainability and health. The other 2 particpants were current customers of Everyday Vegan Grocer.</p>

                <p class="notes">Me (left) conducting a user research session with a participant (bottom) and observer (right) in Zoom.</p>               
            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
                <p>Firstly, I conducted a user interview to understand the <strong>motivations</strong>, <strong>pain points</strong> and <strong>online shopping behaviour</strong> of prospective and current customers.</p>
            <h3>Open Card Sort </h3>
                <p>Secondly, I conducted a moderated open card sort to explore how the current <strong>information architecture could be improved</strong>.</p>
                <p>During the activity, participants grouped 35 Everyday Vegan Grocer products and named the categories themselves.</p>
                <p class="notes">I decided to conduct open card sort rather than a tree test because we would not have been able to reach useful quantitative conclusions with our limited number of participants. Instead, I decided to moderate the session and focus on extracting useful qualitative insights.</p> 
                <img src="evg/card-sort.jpg" alt="Card Sort" width=100% height=auto>
                <p class="notes">The open card sort was conducted using OptimalSort.</p>               
            <h3>Usability Tests</h3>
                <p>Thirdly, I conducted a usability test to identify <strong>usability issues</strong> in the current online store.</p>
                <p>Participants were tasked to use the Everyday Vegan Grocer website to <strong>purchase 5-10 items</strong> that they were interested in buying.</p>
                <p>Participants were reminded to <strong>think aloud</strong> throughout the usability test, and were probed with <strong>follow-up questions</strong> after they completed the task.</p>
                <p class="notes">I conducted the usability test after the open card sort to prevent the navigation structure on the current website (encountered during the usability test) from affecting participants' card sort responses.</p>

            <h3>Personas</h3>
                <p>From the user interviews, we came up with <strong>two personas</strong> that captured the profiles, behaviours and goals of Everyday Vegan Grocer customers.</p>

            <h3>Affinity Mapping</h3>
                <p>The online store gathered an average satisaction score of <strong>5.8 out of 10</strong>, suggesting a need to improve the website.</p>
                <p>We conducted <strong>affinity mapping</strong> using Miro to identify the main themes underlying the usability and information architecture problems.</p>
                <p>Afterward, we <strong>prioritised these issues</strong> based on their severity and frequency, on how easy they were to fix, and whether they hindered the main user flow.</p>

            <h3>Design Limitations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Home Page:</b> 
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Important information was not displayed above the fold.</strong> Users had to scroll down to find the search bar or to view the shop categories and products.</li>
                            <img src="evg/home-p1.jpg" alt="Home Page Problem 1" width=100% height=auto>
                            <li><strong>The "How can I help you?" section was disliked by users.</strong> Users found the dropdown menus confusing and multiple clicks were required to find a single product.</li>
                            <img src="evg/home-p2.gif" alt="Home Page Problem 2" width=100% height=auto>
                            <li><strong>Users were unable to find products that were on sale or new arrivals.</strong> This was because these sections were not shown on the home page, but instead hidden under  "Special Collections" in the navigation bar.</li>
                            <img src="evg/home-p3.jpg" alt="Home Page Problem 3" width=100% height=auto>

                    <li><b>Shop Pages:</b> 
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Subcategories were not used by users to help them find products.</strong> This was because the subcategories (e.g biscuits) were not made prominent on the page.</li>
                            <img src="evg/shop-p1.jpg" alt="Shop Page Problem 1" width=100% height=auto>
                            <li><strong>It was difficult to navigate between the main categories.</strong> For example, to navigate from "Fresh Produce" to "Meat Alternatives", an extra click was required (i.e. Step 2).</li>
                            <img src="evg/shop-p2.jpg" alt="Shop Page Problem 2" width=100% height=auto>
                            <li><strong>Lots of scrolling was required to browse products.</strong> This was because each product took up the entire width of the page.</li>
                            <img src="evg/shop-p3.gif" alt="Shop Page Problem 3" width=100% height=auto>

                    </li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Information Architecture Limitations</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>There was an unbalanced distribution of subcategories.</strong> For example, "Meat Alternatives" had no subcategories while "Pantry" had 25 subcategories.</li>
                <li><strong>There was an uneven distribution of products between subcategories.</strong> Some subcategories only had 1 item while others had over 40 items.</li>
                <li><strong>Many subcategories were too specific or similar to one another.</strong> For instance, within "Dairy Alternatives", there were five different subcategories for cheese, and two different subcategories for yogurt. Within "Pantry", there was a subcategory for Cereals and another for Breakfast Cereals.</li>
            </ol>

                            <li>We <strong>decreased the size of the banner</strong> and placed the <strong>search bar above the fold</strong>.</li>
                            <li>We <strong>removed the confusing "How can I help you?" section</strong>, and used this "prime real estate" to display shop categories instead to encourage users to start shopping.</li>
                            <li>We made products that were "On Sale" and "New Arrivals" more <strong>prominent on the home page</strong> to make them more easily discoverable.</li>

                <li>We created <strong>new subcategories</strong> (e.g. "Healthy Snacks") and <strong>regrouped specific products</strong> (e.g. "Tofu" is categorised under "Meat Alternatives" instead of "Fresh Produce").</li>

            <h2>5. Test</h2>
            <h3>Participants</h3>
                <p>We conducted our second round of user research with <strong>an existing customer</strong> of Everyday Vegan Grocer.</p>
                <p class="notes">Unfortunately, we only recruited 1 participant due to time constraints and last-minute drop-outs.</p>
            <h3>Testing our Design</h3>
                <p>To evaluate our proposed design, I conducted a <strong>comparative usability test</strong> which compared our prototype with the existing Everyday Vegan Grocer website (before changes were made).</p>
                <p>The participant <strong>preferred our prototype</strong> over the current website, because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Products & categories were displayed first</strong> on the home page, while less important information (recipes, blogs) was displayed later.</li>
                    <li>It was <strong>easier to navigate</strong> between categories & subcategories.</li>
                    <li>The interface was <strong>cleaner and less cluttered</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="evg/design-test.jpg" alt="Testing our Design" width=100% height=auto>
                <p class="notes">The comparative usability test was conducted using Zoom. The user was tasked to buy the same 5 products on our prototype and on the Everyday Vegan Grocer website. To reduce social desirability bias, we told the participant that the prototype was not designed by us.</p>
            <h3>Testing our Information Architecture</h3>
                <p>To test our new information architecture, we conducted a <strong>moderated tree test</strong> for our proposed categories & subcategories.</p>
                <p>The quantitative findings were optimistic. The participant achieved a <strong>success rate of 100%</strong> and a <strong>directness score of 100%</strong> (went to the right category immediately without backtracking). They also took <strong>less than 5 seconds</strong> to find each item.</p>
                <p>We also received positive qualitative feedback. The participant commented that the <strong>categories & subcategories were clear</strong> and the <strong>tree test was "easy!"</strong></p> 
                <p class="notes">Although these findings provide some support to our ideas, we acknowledge that further research is required due to our limited sample size.</p>

            <p>Additionally, the client was satisfied with our ideas and was <strong>particularly pleased with my contributions</strong> to the project.

            <h3>Reflections</h3>
                <p><b>What went well üòÑ:</b> In this project, I made sure that we came up with <strong>actionable solutions</strong>. Initially, I was planning to redesign the website completely and come up with a brand-new interface. However, after communicating with the client and taking the initative to understand their needs, I realised that they wanted solutions that were actionable in the short-term. Hence, I proposed simple design fixes and an improved information architecture, since these ideas are feasible and can be immediately implemented within Everyday Vegan Grocer's current e-commerce platform (Shopify).</p>
                <p><b>What could be improved ü§î:</b> During the project, we faced many <strong>unexpected challenges</strong>. For instance, we experienced technical problems during remote testing, and encountered participants who dropped out from our user research at the last minute. For future work, I plan to incorporate more preparation and contingency measures to ensure that the project progresses as smoothly as possible.</p>
