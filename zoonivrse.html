            <h2>ZooniVRse - Final Concept</h2>
            <p>After following an iterative and user-centred design process, we came up with a concept for our virtual zoo - the ZooniVRse.</p>
            <p>The ZooniVRse is a physical location in the city that people can visit with their loved ones to experience a fully immersive, multisensory and interactive virtual reality (VR) zoo.</p>
            <p>In the realistic VR world (created using computer-generated imagery; CGI), users can engage in various interactions with animals in their natural habitats.</p>

            <h3>VR Booths & VR World</h3>
                <p>The virtual reality experience is supported by equipment and technology in a physical "VR booth" that is located within a building in the city.</p>

                <p>The VR world consists of a ‚Äúhome base‚Äù surrounded by different zones that represent various real-world ecosystems. Users are free to explore the world and interact with realistic CGI animals in their natural habitats.</p>

                </figure>
            <h3>Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Virtual reality was used to provide an <strong>immersive</strong> experience. To enter the realistic VR world, users put on head-mounted devices (HMD). They move around the VR world by walking on an omni-directional treadmill in the VR booths. They can also sit down and use a game controller to move around in the VR world if they are tired or have mobility issues.</p>
                    <li>To emphasise the <strong>social</strong>  nature of the visit, the facial expressions and body movements of users are projected into the VR world. This is enabled by facial-scanning and motion-tracking technology in the VR booths.</li>
                    <li>To provide a <strong>multisensory</strong> experience, the temperature, weather and smells automatically changes to match the ecosystem that the users are experiencing in the VR world. This is supported by the heaters and coolers, fans and moisture diffusers, and olfactory vents in the VR booths.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Activities</h3>
                <ul> 
                    <li><strong>Touch Me: </strong>Users can choose to "pet" the animals they meet. In the physical VR booths, ultrasonic technology (e.g. Ultrealeap) is used to generate the haptic sensations of an animal‚Äôs texture.</li>  
                    <li><strong>Play Mini- Game: </strong>Users can engage in single or multiplayer games that involve the encountered animal (e.g. "Escape the Tiger")</li>  
                    <li><strong>See Me in Action: </strong>Users can view a realistic simulation of the animal engaging in an activity that is rarely seen in the real world (e.g. parrot mating ritual).</li>  
                    <li><strong>Learn More: </strong>Users can read more about the habitats, behaviour traits of the conversation status of the animal.</li>  
                </ul>

                <p>In the following sections, I outline the user-centred and iterative <strong>design process</strong> that we went through to come up with the final concept of our virtual zoo.</p>

            <h2>1. Discovering User Needs</h2>
            <h3>Survey</h3>
                <p>To identify user needs and establish requirements for our virtual zoo, we created a survey using Qualtrics and distributed it to 127 adults via convenience sampling. Through our survey, we sought to understand what motivated people to visit physical zoos and what they liked or disliked about physical zoos. We found that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>People visited zoos because they wanted to see and interact with <strong>real animals</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Zoo visits were <strong>social</strong>: 95% of our survey respondents went to the zoo with their family, friends or significant others.</li>
                    <li>People disliked zoos because of <strong>ethical concerns</strong>. They did not like how animals were in unnatural habitats, had insufficient space, were kept in captivity and were exploited for entertainment.</li>
                    <li>People also disliked the <strong>physical discomfort</strong> associated with zoos. They were especially deterred by unpleasant smells, bad weather and the fatigue from walking around.</li>
                </ul>
                <figure>

                    <figcaption>Affinity map of survey insights (Miro).</figcaption>
                </figure>
            <h3>Observational Studies</h3>
                <p>We also conducted observational studies at both the ZSL London Zoo and the San Diego Zoo to understand the behaviour and pain points of zoo visitors. These are some of our main findings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Visitors showed interest in interacting with the animals, often waving at them and talking to them.</li>
                    <li>Almost every visitor was accompanied by their loved ones.</li>
                    <li>Some animals were clearly in unnatural habitats (e.g. polar bear in 30 degrees Celsius heat).</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                <p>I conducted a competitor analysis to understand why existing virtual zoo experiences have limited appeal in comparison to physical zoos. The competitor analysis revealed that commercial zoo experiences were typically split into two categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Live Tours of Existing Zoos: </strong>these virtual zoo experiences involve a tour guide giving a live tour of an existing physical zoo. Although these experiences are social and incorporate real animals, visitors are unable to interact with the animals and there may be ethical concerns about how the animals are treated in the physical zoo.</li>
                    <li><strong>Computer-Generated Animals: </strong>these virtual zoo experiences include video games (e.g. Planet Zoo, Zoo World VR, ZooAR), and educational applications (Mammals by Tinybop, Zoptiks). While these games and applications are highly interactive and engaging, they often lack a sense of immersion as the animals do not look realistic, and lack a social component since they are designed for individuals.</li>
                </ul>
                <figure>

            <h3>Persona</h3>
                <p>Based on our initial user research, we came up with a persona to describe potential visitors of our virtual zoo:</p>

            <h3>Virtual Zoo Requirements</h3>
                <p>We also established the following requirements for our virtual zoo:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our virtual zoo should be <strong>realistic</strong> and <strong>interactive</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Our virtual zoo should emphasise the visit as a <strong>social activity.</strong></li>
                    <li>Our virtual zoo should address the <strong>ethical issues</strong> and <strong>physical discomfort</strong> associated with real zoos.</p>

                <p>Keeping the persona and the requirements in mind, we began ideation with a <strong>diverging</strong> process. Each team individually generated a wide range of ideas and portrayed them using sketches & storyboards.</p>
                <p>We then began a <strong>converging</strong> process, where we started to merge and group similar ideas together.</p>
                <p>After this process, we came up with the <strong>initial concept</strong> for our virtual zoo - a physical location in the city that people can visit with their loved ones to experience an immersive, multisensory and interactive virtual reality (VR) zoo.</p>

                <h3>User Interviews</h3>
                    <p>After defining our initial concept, we conducted <strong>user interviews</strong> with 8 participants who fit our persona to get their feedback on our ideas.</p>
                    <p>We used our sketches and storyboards as <strong>design probes</strong> during the interviews, and asked participants if they had any opinions, concerns or suggestions regarding the layout of the VR booth, the design of the virtual world and the specific features and interactions.</p>
                    <p>After conducting the interviews, we grouped responses from the participants into themes and used these insights to <strong>refine our ideas</strong> for the ZooniVRse.</p>
                <h3>Refining the ZooniVRse</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The interview insights helped us to narrow down our ideas. </strong>For example, we removed some of our ideas that were not well-received by our potential users (e.g. fictional animals, companion mobile app).</li>
                        <li><strong>The interview insights informed our design of the physical VR booths. </strong>For instance, we realised that users may feel tired from constantly walking (on an omnidirectional treadmill) or were worried about "VR sickness", so we introduced chairs and 2D screens so participants could take breaks from the VR experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>The interview insights gave us ideas for specific interactions in the VR world. </strong>Users indicated interest in touching animals and seeing rare events, so we incoporated a "Touch Me" and "See Me in Action" activity into our virtual zoo.</li>
                        <li><strong>The interview insights helped us to identify user concerns. </strong>Some users expressed worry about being sensitive to certain smells and extreme temperatures, or did not want get a shock if they accidentally "touch" an animal. Thus, we made all multisensory experiences (e.g. weather changes, tactile experiences) optional and adjustable by the user.</li>

                <h3>Digital Prototype</h3>
                    <p>In the VR world of the ZooniVRse, users can interact with the animals they encounter by participating in various ‚Äúactivities‚Äù.</p>
                    <p>I created an interactive click-through <strong>digital prototype</strong> (using Figma) to illustrate some of these activities.</p>

                <h3>User Testing</h3>
                    <p>After refining our ideas and creating our prototypes, we conducted <strong>user testing</strong> with 6 participants who fit our persona.</p>
                    <p>Since we were unable to conduct in-person user testing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we created a <strong>video prototype</strong> for remote testing (an earlier version of our <a href="#zoo-video">concept video</a>). The video walkthrough shows the journey of "Emma" as she visits the ZooniVRse, including her entering a physical VR booth with her friends, exploring the VR world, and engaging in the different activities.</p>
                    <p>We then used the insights from user testing to <strong>refine our ideas</strong> for the ZooniVRse.</p>
                <h3>Refining the ZooniVRse</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Insights from user testing helped us refine the physical VR booths. </strong>Based on user feedback, we redesigned the VR booths to be more spacious and to facilitate social interaction. We also incorporated facial-scanning and motion-tracking technology into our concept to capture the facial expressions and body movements of users to increase immersion and emphasise the social nature of the visit.</li>
                        <li><strong>Insights from user testing helped us refine the VR world. </strong>Users indicated that they were not sure where they should walk towards in the VR world, so we included "hiking paths" into our concept to guide visitors toward interesting landmarks.</li>
                        <li><strong>The interview insights helped us to refine the activities and interactions. </strong>Many users were not interested in our idea of a "Livecam" activity, where visitors will get to view livecams of animals in zoos all around the world. Thus, we removed this activity from the ZooniVRse. Users also indicated an interest in learning about animal conservation, so we added more information about conservation efforts in our "Learn More" activity.</li>

            <h2>Outcome & Reflections</h2>
                <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>Our final concept for the ZooniVRse was <strong>well-received</strong> by our users and mentors.</p>
                    <p>Overall, the ZooniVRse improves upon existing <strong>virtual zoo experiences</strong> by providing a more immersive, integrated and social experience.</p>
                    <p>Furthermoer, the ZooniVRse improves upon <strong>real zoos</strong> by eliminating the tension between users‚Äô ethical concerns about animal welfare and their desire to interact with animals in a social outing.</p>
                <h3>Reflections</h3>
                    <p>From this project, I learnt how to <strong>prototype creatively</strong>. Even though we wanted to evaluate specific aspects of our concept, we were not able to create a hi-fidelity prototype because of the complexity of our concept. To overcome this limitation, we instead created separate low-fidelity prototypes to test different aspects of our concept: a physical mockup to evaluate whether users liked the layout of the VR booths; a video game prototype to test how users feel about the virtual world; and an interactive digital prototype to understand what activites users would like to engage in within the ZooniVrse.</p>
                    <p>I also learnt how to <strong>work remotely</strong> during this project. Our team was based across the UK and USA, and all our user research had to be conducted remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We used different tools to facilitate remote collaboration (e.g. Zoom, Team, Miro, Notion), and came up with creative ways to conduct evaluations of our concept (e.g. design probes, video prototype).</p>
