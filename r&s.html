            <div>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>University College London (UCL) is a <strong>top university in the UK</strong> that is continually striving to advance <strong>equality, diversity and inclusion</strong> for staff and students.</p>
                <p>In fact, UCL was the first university in England to <strong>welcome women on equal terms with men</strong> and to admit <strong>students of all religions!</strong></p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>The university has a Report and Support (R&S) platform that allows students and staff to <strong>report incidents</strong> of bullying, harassment and misconduct, or <strong>contact advisors for support.</strong></p>
                <p>However, the team have received feedback that the <strong>website (front-end)</strong> is confusing and hard to navigate, and that the <strong>case management system (back-end)</strong> is difficult to use.
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>The Goal</h3>
                <p>Evaluate the user experience of both the <strong>website (front-end)</strong> and the <strong>case management system (back-end)</strong> of the platform.</p> 
                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>As a <strong>UX Evaluator</strong>, I conducted user research with students and staff, defined the usability and information architecture issues, and presented design ideas in a research report.</p>

            <h2>1. Empathise</h2>
            <h3>Front-End</h3>
                <p>To evaluate the website, we conducted user research with <strong>12 students</strong> who were a mix of undergraduate and postgraduate students of different genders, ethnicities and nationalities.</p>
                <p>At the start of the session, participants were presented with a <strong>usability test</strong>. In particular, they were given a fictional scenario and asked to think-aloud as they (1) reported the incident and (2) found relevant information to get support.</p>
                <p>After the usability test, we conducted an <strong>open card sort</strong> to evaluate the information architecture of the support pages. We asked users to sort articles on the website into groups and come up with their own names for the categories.</p>
                <p>Finally, we ended the session with a <strong>semi-structured interview</strong>. We asked participants to elaborate on how they made some certain decisions during the usability test and card sort and to provide additional feedback on the reporting platform.</p>
            <h3>Back-End</h3>
                <p>To evaluate the case management system, we conducted user research with <strong>5 UCL staff</strong>. There were 2 administrators (responsible for managing and assigning reports), 1 responder (responsible for following up and providing support to relevant parties), 1 analyst (responsible for tracking the analytics of the reporting platform),  and 1 general manager.</p>
                <p>Firstly, participants were presented with a <strong>usability test</strong>. More specifically, they were asked to perform a task that they usually do on the case management system while verbalising their thoughts.</p>
                <p>Secondly, we followed up with a <strong>semi-structured interview</strong>, asking participants to elaborate further on their decisions and provide additional insights.</p>
                <p>In addition, we also conducted a <strong>survey</strong> with 18 additional staff who used the case management system for various purposes. They were asked to rate their experience with the platform, share what they liked or disliked about the platform, and provide suggestions on how the platform could be improved.</p>

                            <li>There should be features that allow pages to follow a <strong>non-linear layout</strong> (e.g. CSS grid) and allow <strong>in-page links</strong> for different sections.</li>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
                <p>At the end of the project, we produced a <strong>research report</strong> with detailed descriptions of the research insights and design recommendations.</p>
                <p>The Report & Support (R&S) team was <strong>very pleased</strong> with how the project went and the final deliverables. They <strong>published our research report</strong> on <a class="left-hover" target="_blank" href="https://report-support.ucl.ac.uk/support/report-and-support-user-experience-evaluation">their website</a> and <strong>distributed it to the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion team</strong>. They are currently working to <strong>implement the design solutions</strong> on both the website (front-end) and the case management system (back-end).</p>

                        <p>"Jingxiu quickly established rapport with users during usability tests and interviews leading to very in-depth insightful data extraction. As the team's manager, I was very impressed with Jingxiu's ability to quickly grasp the needs of the stakeholders and our expectations from project and convert the UX research data into clearly articulated actionable insights that we can follow to improve the platform. The evaluation report was highly praised by senior management at UCL, which, given the rigour of research we do at UCL, is an evidence to his incredible performance. Lastly, this project was a team-project and Jingxiu not only acted as a great team-player but also worked with minimum supervision which in my opinion makes him a great fit in fast-paced work environments. I highly recommend Jingxiu and certain that he will be a great asset to any team he works for."</p>

            <h3>Reflections</h3>
                <p><b>What went well üòÑ:</b> I ensured that the project progressed smoothly by <strong>planning early and preparing contingency measures</strong>. Since, this project had a tight 2-month timeline, we recruited a surplus of participants early to reduce the impact of last-minute drop outs, and conducted pilot studies to ensure that our user research sessions proceeded as planned.</p>
                <p><b>What could be improved ü§î:</b> In this project, I went into user research sessions with <strong>preconceived expectations</strong> of what I might find. As a result, I was surprised by some of the usability issues that emerged during the user research sessions. In future projects, I plan to remind myself to treat users as the experts and reduce my bias toward my own judgments.</p>
