                        <p class="date">Sep 2017- May 2020</p>
                        <p>I took an undergraduate degree in Psychology, because I was passionate about understanding how our minds work and why we behave in certain ways.</p>
                        <p>Apart from excelling in the course (I graduated top of my cohort!), I was also heavily involved in perception, memory and decision-making research. I worked as a Research Assistant across various labs in UCL, and took up summer research internships at the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience and Johns Hopkins University.</p>
                        <p>In these three years, I obtained deep knowledge of human cognition and behaviour, and gained valuable research and data analysis skills.</p>

                        <p class="date">May 2020 - Jun 2020</p>
                        <p>I first came across User Experience (UX) in the final year of my BSc Psychology degree, when I took a module in Human-Computer Interaction.</p>
                        <p>I immediately fell in love with this field, so I started reading books, taking online courses and doing self-initated projects to learn as much as I could about user research, UI design and front-end development.</p>

                        <p class="date">Jun 2020 - Aug 2020</p>
                        <p>While attempting to learn everything UX-related, I did a virtual internship with CuriousCore - an education startup that specialises in UX courses.</p>
                        <p>As a Product Research Intern, I conducted user research and used the insights to enhance the UX of their live website. I also helped out as a Teaching Assistant, where I supported students with their real-world UX projects and helped to conduct lessons on UX Research & Figma.</p>
                        <p>In these three months, I acquired a strong understanding of UX and the Design Thinking process.</p>

                        <p>In the month of September, I conducted my first UX project! 
                        <p>I worked remotely as a UX Researcher for a vegan grocery based in Singapore, to improve the user experience and information architecture of their online e-commerce website. My main responsibility was to conduct user research to (1) discover the usability issues of the current website and to (2) test the effectiveness of our ideas.</p>
                        <p>This project taught me that UX Design is a messy process, and gave me the opportunity to learn how to adapt to real-world constraints.
