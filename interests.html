    <p>I believe in giving back to the community. Since I have not been making any money as a student, I have been giving my time to help those in need.</p>
    <p>While I was an undergraduate in London, I volunteered at the Phoenix&nbsp;Recovery&nbsp;Service at <em>Mind&nbsp;in&nbsp;Camden</em> which provided a support service for individuals with long-term mental health issues. As a <strong>Phoenix&nbsp;Recovery&nbsp;Worker</strong>, I facilitated a peer-support group for vulnerable individuals suffering from anxiety, helped service users accomplish their daily tasks and performed administrative duties to assist the running of the service. I also volunteered as an <strong>Academic&nbsp;Tutor</strong> at <em>Newham&nbsp;Collegiate&nbsp;Sixth&nbsp;Form&nbsp;Centre</em>, where I conducted A&nbsp;Level Psychology tutorials for a class of disadvantaged students. I was also the <strong>Outreach&nbsp;Director</strong>&nbsp;(2018/19) of the <em>UCL&nbsp;Volunteering&nbsp;Society</em>!</p>
    <p>During the summer of 2018,  I spent five weeks in Colombo,&nbsp;Sri Lanka, as a <strong>Mental&nbsp;Health&nbsp;Support&nbsp;Worker</strong> with <em>SLV.Global</em>. My main responsibility was to plan and conduct projects aimed at improving the physical and psychological well-being of service users, which included mental health patients at psychiatric hospitals as well as individuals with special needs such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Down's syndrome.</p>
    <p>Before embarking on my undergraduate studies, I volunteered in Singapore as an <strong>Activity&nbsp;Support&nbsp;Worker</strong> at <em>Stroke&nbsp;Support&nbsp;Station&nbsp;(S3)</em>, where I facilitated the running of art, cooking and mindfulness sessions for stroke survivors. I also volunteered with <em>Muscular&nbsp;Dystrophy&nbsp;Association&nbsp;Singapore&nbsp;(MDAS)</em> as a <strong>Power&nbsp;Soccer&nbsp;Coach</strong>, where I planned and conducted wheelchair soccer training for individuals with muscular dystrophy.</p>

        <p>I have been playing the guitar since I was thirteen, and currently hold a <strong>Diploma&nbsp;in&nbsp;Classical&nbsp;Guitar&nbsp;Performance</strong> from the <em>London&nbsp;College&nbsp;of&nbsp;Music (LCM)</em>. I also previously attained Grade&nbsp;8&nbsp;(Distinction) in Classical&nbsp;Guitar from LCM.</p> 
        <p>Back in 2013 and 2014, I worked part-time as a <strong>Classical&nbsp;Guitar&nbsp;Teacher</strong> at <em>The&nbsp;Music&nbsp;Atelier</em>, and was a <strong>Section&nbsp;Leader</strong> in the <em>Victoria&nbsp;Junior&nbsp;College&nbsp;(VJC) Guitar Ensemble</em>.</p>
        <p>Apart from classical and acoustic guitar, I also play the <strong>piano!</strong></p>

    <h2>Travel</h2>
    <p>I love travelling around the world to collect new experiences, learn about different cultures and get myself out of my comfort zone.</p>
    <p>Some of my most memorable trips include interning as a <strong>Research Assistant at Johns&nbsp;Hopkins&nbsp;University</strong> in <em>Baltimore,&nbsp;United States</em>, volunteering in a <strong>Psychology&nbsp;Placement&nbsp;Programme</strong> in <em>Colombo,&nbsp;Sri Lanka</em>, participating in a <strong>Music&nbsp;Exchange&nbsp;Trip</strong> with VJC Guitar Ensemble in <em>Kyushu,&nbsp;Japan</em>, and taking a 3D2N hike up <strong>Mt.&nbsp;Rinjani</strong> in <em>Lombok,&nbsp;Indonesia</em>.</p>
    <p>Since I'm currently studying in London, I am currently using this opportunity to travel around Europe as much as I can! (currently paused due to COVID-19 &#128546)</p>
